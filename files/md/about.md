### College
I currently attend The University of Virginia. I am majoring Computer Science in the School of Engineering, and minoring in Physics. See my [resume](/resume) for more details.

### Linux
I have been using Linux for 3 years and I'm currently using [Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org). During this time, I have tinkered with the linux operating system and gained a fair amount of knowledge of how it works. I've written numerous scripts to automate my workflow and created several simple commandline tools as personal projects.
